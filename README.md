    - `App.js`: Main component rendering the header, info section, sign-up form, and footer.
    - `Header.js`: Header component with navigation links.
    - `InfoSection.js`: Information section providing details about Nosres.
    - `SignUpForm.js`: Sign-up form component with real-time validation and form submission.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository

 

2. Navigate to the project directory



3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the application is available on CodeSandbox at [[https://6jkhdh.csb.app/](https://8lcvwp.csb.app/)].

## Special Considerations

- Real-time form validation ensures that users provide accurate information.
- The application uses React, Vite, Material-UI components, and react-router-dom for navigation.
- The project is structured for modularity, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy creating your Nosres Account!
